## P1


## 1.1

1. False
This statement is the converse of contraction mapping theorem. It is not true. One simple well-known example is f(x)=cos(x) defined on x=[0, PI] is not a contraction mapping, with d(x, y)=|x-y|_p (any p-norm).

2. False
This theorem misses the empty metric case. If the set S is empty, then the state does not hold.

3. True
